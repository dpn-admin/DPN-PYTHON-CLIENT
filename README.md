# dpn-rest-client

A simple, standalone Python REST client for DPN. This is written for
Python 3.4, but should run just as well on Python 2.7.

To get started quickly in Python 3.4:

```
git clone git@github.com:dpn-admin/DPN-PYTHON-CLIENT.git
cd dpn-rest-client
pyvenv .dpn
source .dpn/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
